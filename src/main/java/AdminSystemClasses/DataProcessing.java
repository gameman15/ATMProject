/*
  This may be more than a single class file (ATMDataProcess/CustomerDataProcess) 
  but they essentially do the same thing - take the webform input and (using HibernateDBIO)
  create the output data to send back to the web.

  If you are not working on HibernateDBIO, then just use dummy valid data returns for 
  testing.  I'll integrate it later.
